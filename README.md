# Multi Keyboards
Adds support for low end bar code scanners, which work as a keyboard only.

This is a full solution for getting code scanned from multiple low end bar code scanners, including:
* Multiple scanners support
* Charaters combine until stop sign (e.g., Enter)
* User-defined key-to-text mapping

# Note
Package is built on dotNet framework 4.0 and support x86 (32bit) platform target only. You can use this code on x64 but still need to keep the platform target for build x86 instead of Any CPU or x64.

# Thanks
Many thanks to Emma Burrows and Steve Messer. They explained the API of Windows in https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/17123/Using-Raw-Input-from-C-to-handle-multiple-keyboard.
